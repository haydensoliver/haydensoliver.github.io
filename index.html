# Hello there!

In general, there's a lot of information on this page. Not so today. I'm still working on compiling everything into a neat and tidy little site.

- Here is where my graduating thesis at Brigham Young University is going to be.

- Here is my resume (different versions for different experiences).

- Here is a link to several of my projects, collaborator's work, and other relevant pages.
